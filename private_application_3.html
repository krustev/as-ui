              developments. For the latest information about developments related
              to Form W-9 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after
              they were published, go to www.irs.gov/FormW9.Purpose of FormAn individual
              or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information
              return with the IRS must obtain your correct taxpayer identification
              number (TIN) which may be your social security number (SSN), individual
              taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification
              number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN), to report on
              an information return the amount paid to you, or other amount reportable
              on an information return. Examples of information returns include,
              but are not limited to, the following.• Form 1099-INT (interest earned
              or paid)• Form 1099-DIV (dividends, including those from stocks or
              mutual funds)• Form 1099-MISC (various types of income, prizes, awards,
              or gross proceeds)• Form 1099-B (stock or mutual fund sales and certain
              other transactions by brokers)• Form 1099-S (proceeds from real estate
              transactions)• Form 1099-K (merchant card and third party network transactions)•
              Form 1098 (home mortgage interest), 1098-E (student loan interest),

              or abandonment of secured property)Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S.
              person (including a resident alien), to provide your correct TIN. If
              you do not return Form W-9 to the requester with a TIN, you might be
              subject to backup withholding. See What is backup withholding, later.Cat.
              No. 10231XForm W-9 (Rev. 11-2017) Form W-9 (Rev. 11-2017)Page 2 By
              signing the filled-out form, you: 1. Certify that the TIN you are giving
              is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued),2. Certify
              that you are not subject to backup withholding, or3. Claim exemption
              from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If applicable,
              you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share
              of any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject
              to the withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected
              income, and 4. Certify that FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if
              any) indicating that you are exempt from the FATCA reporting, is correct.
              See What is FATCA reporting, later, for further information.Note: If
              you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form
              W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester’s form if it is
              substantially similar to this Form W-9.Definition of a U.S. person.
              For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:•
              An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;• A partnership,
              corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United
              States or under the laws of the United States;• An estate (other than
              a foreign estate); or• A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations
              section 301.7701-7).Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that
              conduct a trade or business in the United States are generally required
              to pay a withholding tax under section 1446 on any foreign partners’
              share of effectively connected taxable income from such business. Further,
              in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, the rules
              under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner
              is a foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore,
              if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting
              a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership
              to establish your U.S. status and avoid section 1446 withholding on
              your share of partnership income.In the cases below, the following
              person must give Form W-9 to the partnership for purposes of establishing
              its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its allocable share of
              net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business in the
              United States.• In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner,
              the U.S. owner of the disregarded entity and not the entity;• In the
              case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally,
              the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the
              trust; and• In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust),
              the U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries
              of the trust.Foreign person. If you are a foreign person or the U.S.
              branch of a foreign bank that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person,
              do not use Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-8 or Form
              8233 (see Pub. 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign
              Entities).Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally,
              only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty
              to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However,
              most tax treaties contain a provision known as a “saving clause.” Exceptions
              specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to
              continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise
              become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.If you are a U.S. resident
              alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause
              of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types
              of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the
              following five items.1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be
              the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident
              alien.2. The treaty article addressing the income.3. The article number
              (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving clause and
              its exceptions.4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for
              the exemption from tax.5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption
              from tax under the terms of the treaty article.Example. Article 20
              of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for
              scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present
              in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident
              alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds
              5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the
              U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article
              20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident
              alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this
              exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying
              on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship
              or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes
              the information described above to support that exemption.If you are
              a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the appropriate
              completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.Backup WithholdingWhat is backup withholding?
              Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions
              withhold and pay to the IRS 28% of such payments. This is called “backup
              withholding.” Payments that may be subject to backup withholding include
              interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange
              transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in settlement
              of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain payments
              from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject
              to backup withholding.You will not be subject to backup withholding
              on payments you receive if you give the requester your correct TIN,
              make the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest
              and dividends on your tax return.Payments you receive will be subject
              to backup withholding if: 1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,2.
              You do not certify your TIN when required (see the instructions for
              Part II for details),3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished
              an incorrect TIN,4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup
              withholding because you did not report all your interest and dividends
              on your tax return (for reportable interest and dividends only), or5.
              You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup
              withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts
              opened after 1983 only).Certain payees and payments are exempt from
              backup withholding. See Exempt payee code, later, and the separate
              Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.Also
              see Special rules for partnerships, earlier.What is FATCA Reporting?The
              Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating
              foreign financial institution to report all United States account holders
              that are specified United States persons. Certain payees are exempt
              from FATCA reporting. See Exemption from FATCA reporting code, later,
              and the Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.Updating
              Your InformationYou must provide updated information to any person
              to whom you claimed to be an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt
              payee and anticipate receiving reportable payments in the future from
              this person. For example, you may need to provide updated information
              if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S corporation, or if
              you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new Form
              W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account; for example, if the
              grantor of a grantor trust dies.PenaltiesFailure to furnish TIN. If
              you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are subject
              to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due
              to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.Civil penalty for false
              information with respect to withholding. If you make a false statement
              with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding, you
              are subject to a $500 penalty. Form W-9 (Rev. 11-2017)Page 3 Criminal
              penalty for falsifying information. Willfully falsifying certifications
              or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines
              and/or imprisonment.Misuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses
              TINs in violation of federal law, the requester may be subject to civil
              and criminal penalties.Specific InstructionsLine 1You must enter one
              of the following on this line; do not leave this line blank. The name
              should match the name on your tax return.If this Form W-9 is for a
              joint account (other than an account maintained by a foreign financial
              institution (FFI)), list first, and then circle, the name of the person
              or entity whose number you entered in Part I of Form W-9. If you are
              providing Form W-9 to an FFI to document a joint account, each holder
              of the account that is a U.S. person must provide a Form W-9.a. Individual.
              Generally, enter the name shown on your tax return. If you have changed
              your last name without informing the Social Security Administration
              (SSA) of the name change, enter your first name, the last name as shown
              on your social security card, and your new last name. Note: ITIN applicant:
              Enter your individual name as it was entered on your Form W-7 application,
              line 1a. This should also be the same as the name you entered on the
              Form 1040/1040A/1040EZ you filed with your application.b. Sole proprietor
              or single-member LLC. Enter your individual name as shown on your 1040/1040A/1040EZ
              on line 1. You may enter your business, trade, or “doing business as”
              (DBA) name on line 2.c. Partnership, LLC that is not a single-member
              LLC, C corporation, or S corporation. Enter the entity's name as shown
              on the entity's tax return on line 1 and any business, trade, or DBA
              name on line 2.d. Other entities. Enter your name as shown on required
              U.S. federal tax documents on line 1. This name should match the name
              shown on the charter or other legal document creating the entity. You
              may enter any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.e. Disregarded
              entity. For U.S. federal tax purposes, an entity that is disregarded
              as an entity separate from its owner is treated as a “disregarded entity.”
              See Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iii). Enter the owner's name
              on line 1. The name of the entity entered on line 1 should never be
              a disregarded entity. The name on line 1 should be the name shown on
              the income tax return on which the income should be reported. For example,
              if a foreign LLC that is treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
              tax purposes has a single owner that is a U.S. person, the U.S. owner's
              name is required to be provided on line 1. If the direct owner of the
              entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner that is
              not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the disregarded entity's
              name on line 2, “Business name/disregarded entity name.” If the owner
              of the disregarded entity is a foreign person, the owner must complete
              an appropriate Form W-8 instead of a Form W-9. This is the case even
              if the foreign person has a U.S. TIN. Line 2If you have a business

              Number (TIN)Enter your TIN in the appropriate box. If you are a resident

              TIN is your IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Enter
              it in the social security number box. If you do not have an ITIN, see
              How to get a TIN below.If you are a sole proprietor and you have an
              EIN, you may enter either your SSN or EIN. If you are a single-member
              LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, enter
              the owner’s SSN (or EIN, if the owner has one). Do not enter the disregarded
              entity’s EIN. If the LLC is classified as a corporation or partnership,
              enter the entity’s EIN.Note: See What Name and Number To Give the Requester,
              later, for further clarification of name and TIN combinations.How to
              get a TIN. If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To
              apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security
              Card, from your local SSA office or get this form online at www.SSA.gov.
              You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7,
              Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply
              for an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification
              Number, to apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing
              the IRS website at www.irs.gov/Businesses and clicking on Employer
              Identification Number (EIN) under Starting a Business. Go to www.irs.gov/Forms
              to view, download, or print Form W-7 and/or Form SS-4. Or, you can
              go to www.irs.gov/OrderForms to place an order and have Form W-7 and/or
              SS-4 mailed to you within 10 business days.If you are asked to complete
              Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN and write “Applied
              For” in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it
              to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments
              made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will
              have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are
              subject to backup withholding on payments. The 60-day rule does not
              apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding
              on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the requester.Note:
              Entering “Applied For” means that you have already applied for a TIN
              or that you intend to apply for one soon.Caution: A disregarded U.S.
              entity that has a foreign owner must use the appropriate Form W-8.Part
              II. CertificationTo establish to the withholding agent that you are
              a U.S. person, or resident alien, sign Form W-9. You may be requested
              to sign by the withholding agent even if item 1, 4, or 5 below indicates
              otherwise.For a joint account, only the person whose TIN is shown in
              Part I should sign (when required). In the case of a disregarded entity,
              the person identified on line 1 must sign. Exempt payees, see Exempt

              Tax Records From Identity TheftIdentity theft occurs when someone uses
              your personal information such as your name, SSN, or other identifying
              information, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes.
              An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a tax return
              using your SSN to receive a refund.To reduce your risk:• Protect your
              SSN,• Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and• Be careful
              when choosing a tax preparer.If your tax records are affected by identity
              theft and you receive a notice from the IRS, respond right away to
              the name and phone number printed on the IRS notice or letter.If your
              tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think
              you are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable
              credit card activity or credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft
              Hotline at 1-800-908-4490 or submit Form 14039.For more information,

              from suspicious emails or phishing schemes. Phishing is the creation
              and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business
              emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user
              falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt
              to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be
              used for identity theft. Form W-9 (Rev. 11-2017)Page 6 The IRS does
              not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does
              not request personal detailed information through email or ask taxpayers
              for the PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information
              for their credit card, bank, or other financial accounts.If you receive
              an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this message
              to phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo,
              or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
              (TIGTA) at 1-800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the

              the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct TIN
              to persons (including federal agencies) who are required to file information
              returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other
              income paid to you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or
              abandonment of secured property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions
              you made to an IRA, Archer MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this
              form uses the information on the form to file information returns with
              the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses of this information
              include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal
              litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S.
              commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their laws.
              The information also may be disclosed to other countries under a treaty,
              to federal and state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or
              to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism.
              You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a
              tax return. Under section 3406, payers must generally withhold a percentage
              of taxable interest, dividend, and certain other payments to a payee
              who does not give a TIN to the payer. Certain penalties may also apply
              for providing false or fraudulent information.
